	<main>
	<p>I am a 24 year old Murfreesboro, Tennessee native. My major is Management Information Systems. I gradute in a week. My favorite sports are hockey and football and my favorite teams
	are the Nashville Predators and the Georgia Bulldogs.</p>

	<p>My girlfriend and I have been together for over 4 years. We have a dog, named Kappa, who will be 1 year old in January.</p>

	<p>I am a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. I spent the last year serving as the Vice President. My fraternity is something I will always hold dear.
	It has helped me to overcome my fear of speaking in front of groups and has helped me hone my people skills.</p>

	<p>I transferred to UTM from Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU). I spent 3 semesters at MTSU and then decided I needed to move to a different town and attend
	a different university. Coming to UTM was one of the best decisions I ever made. The faculty and staff has done an outstanding job in preparing me for the real world.
	Thanks to my amazing professors, I feel confident that I can tackle any task my career will throw at me.</p>

	<p>My time as a UTM student has come to a close. It has been a wonderful experience that I wouldn't trade for anything.</p>
